This is a simple Android app that acts as a simple drum machine. It was made for an Android App Development class final project. It should be noted that functionally, this is not a good drum machine, since some important actions aren't tied to a clock (triggers for sound and some animation are tied to visual events, i.e. when the green bar is on the location of the screen). The overall goal was to demonstrate some understanding of creating an Android App, not audio programming.

*Audio may not work, since original trigger sound files couldn't be found. Not sure if this will break the app itself. Worked fine when originally deployed on given tablet for class, and on phone*


Essentially the app allows the user to create simple 'beats' by touching on 'rails' where the beat lies, and switching between different beat values and bpm. User can then hit play button to hear the beat as a green play guide line runs across the rails, kinda like Guitar Hero.
